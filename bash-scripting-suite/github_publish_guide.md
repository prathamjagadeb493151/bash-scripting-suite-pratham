# GitHub Publishing Guide

1. Create repository on GitHub (public) — name it `bash-scripting-suite-pratham` or similar.

2. From the project root:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Bash Scripting Suite — Pratham Jagadeb"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

3. Create a release (optional) and upload the zip if requested by evaluators.

4. Add a short README summary in the repo description and link any demo video you record.

Notes:
- If your college requires a specific report format, add it as `report.pdf` or `report.md`.
- For evaluation, include `presentation_one_slide.md` as your slide and speaker notes.
